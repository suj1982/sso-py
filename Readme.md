Implementing a single sign-on (SSO) solution that integrates multiple applications and APIs with OAuth and OpenID Connect involves several steps. Below is a simplified Python example using the Flask framework, which demonstrates the flow for a basic web application.

Please note that the actual implementation can vary based on the specific requirements, identity providers, and frameworks used in your environment. Additionally, this example assumes a simplified scenario and does not cover the security best practices necessary for a production environment.


About the Web App:
In this example:

The Flask app defines routes for home, login, and logout.
It uses the Authlib library to handle OAuth/OpenID Connect authentication.
The OAUTH_PROVIDERS dictionary holds the configuration for different identity providers (Google and GitHub in this case).
The login route provides links to login with Google or GitHub.
The login_provider and authorize routes handle the OAuth authentication flow.
The logout route clears the user session.
Remember to replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration. Additionally, this example assumes that you have registered your application with the respective identity providers and obtained client IDs and secrets.

Note: This example doesn't cover aspects such as handling user sessions securely, securing routes, or production-ready configurations. In a real-world scenario, you should consider using a mature authentication library and follow best practices for security.
